This challenge is a ROC-AUC evaluated synthetically generated dataset in the Playground Kaggle Series. The target is to predict probability of customer getting a loan. (output: [0, 1]). It uses Classifier models - mainly XGBClassifier, CatboostClassifier, RandomForestClassifier.

The model of choice can be deployed as API (with or without Docker) using FastAPI. The API has data quality checks it performs on the input data.

-> For the FASTAPI app without docker, testing predictions locally can be done by running deployment/test_api_local.sh. It contains the first train set example.

To build the Docker image with the FastAPI:

1. Choose your favorite model in the models/ folder
2. Update the Dockerfile in the root of the project to make sure it copies your favorite model into the Docker container upon build. For XGB the copy statement looks like this: COPY ../codebase/models/XGBClassifier_best.json ./XGBClassifier_best.json
3. Update the deployment/main.py script to load your favorite model
4. Run  (in the root of the project)

    docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t jeltopote/kaggle_loan_approval .
    sudo docker run -p 8000:8000 jeltopote/kaggle_loan_approval
5. To push a newly built docker image to Docker Hub
    docker push jeltopote/kaggle_loan_approval:latest	

-> With Docker running, the application is accessible in a browser on http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs with the Swagger UI
