This challenge is a ROC-AUC evaluated synthetically generated dataset in the Playground Kaggle Series. The target is to predict probability of customer getting a loan. (output: [0, 1]). It uses Classifier models - mainly XGBClassifier, CatboostClassifier, RandomForestClassifier.

The model of choice can be deployed as API (with or without Docker) using FastAPI. The API has data quality checks it performs on the input data.

-> For the FASTAPI app without docker, testing predictions locally can be done by running deployment/test_api_local.sh. It contains the first train set example.

To build the Docker image with the FastAPI:

1. Choose your favorite model in the models/ folder
2. Update the Dockerfile in the root of the project to make sure it copies your favorite model into the Docker container upon build. For XGB the copy statement looks like this: COPY ../codebase/models/XGBClassifier_best.json ./XGBClassifier_best.json
3. Update the deployment/main.py script to load your favorite model
4. For docker deployment, run

    docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t kaggle-loan-approval .
    sudo docker run -p 8000:8000 kaggle-loan-approval

5. To push the newly built docker image to Docker Hub
    docker push kaggle-loan-approval:latest	

-> With Docker running, the application is accessible in a browser on http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs with the Swagger UI


For minikube/Kubernetes (k8s) deployment:
0. Build the docker image with Minikube CLI (image for pod will be unavailable if built with 'normal' docker):

    eval $(minikube docker-env)
    docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t kaggle-loan-approval .

1. In the /k8s dir, run:
    minikube kubectl -- apply -f deployment.yaml
    minikube kubectl -- apply -f service.yaml

2. If desired, verify the resources:
    minikube kubectl -- get pods
    minikube kubectl -- get services

3. Access the application:
    minikube service list
    minikube service kaggle-loan-approval-service

The application is now deployed in minikube. It can be tested with following:
1. Get ip address/port for your service by running minikube kubectl -- get svc
2. Replace the obtained ip and port in following curl statement:


curl -X POST "http://<IP_ADRESS>:<PORT>/predict"      -H "Content-Type: application/json"      -d '{
           "id": 0,
           "person_age": 37,
           "person_income": 35000,
           "person_home_ownership": "RENT",
           "person_emp_length": 0.0,
           "loan_intent": "EDUCATION",
           "loan_grade": "B",
           "loan_amnt": 6000,
           "loan_int_rate": 11.49,
           "loan_percent_income": 0.17,
           "cb_person_default_on_file": "N",
           "cb_person_cred_hist_length": 14
         }'


The response will look like this:
    {"prediction":0.0}
